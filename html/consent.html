        <h2>Key Information</h2>

        You are being asked to participate in a research study. Participation in research is completely voluntary. The purpose of this study is to find out more about how adults use and understand language and how this relates to their understanding of concepts, and their ability to understand the intentions and goals of others. This study will take a total of 1 testing session and will last no longer than 120 minutes. You will be asked to play a game with novel or familiar objects, such as puppets, pictures of cupcakes, or a novel item we have created. You may be asked to answer questions (such as making predictions and providing explanations), make simple judgments, sort objects, learn from and teach others, or observe actions and events as well as perform them themselves. In some studies, you will be asked to view images or watch videos on a computer screen, and with a video camera or eye tracker, we will record where on the screen you are looking. Risks and/or discomforts may include breach of confidentiality. There is no direct benefit to you. The results from the study may contribute to improving our understanding of the way people learn language and develop their linguistic, cognitive, and social abilities.
        <br><br>Dear Participant,
        
        <br>This study is being conducted by Mahesh Srinivasan, associate professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley, and his laboratory of research assistants, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. We invite you to participate in a study exploring language and cognition in adulthood. Please read the following information carefully and select the consent button at the end of this form if you wish to participate. Participation is entirely voluntary. If anything is not clear, please do not hesitate to ask questions.
    </p>

        <h2>Study Procedures</h2>

        There will be 1 session, lasting no longer than 120 minutes. During this session, you will participate in experiments about language and cognition. We investigate a variety of topics including people’s knowledge of words and grammatical structures, and how this relates to their understanding of concepts (e.g., their knowledge of objects, substances, time, and number), and their ability to understand the intentions and goals of others (e.g., what other people believe and want). Additionally, we explore how these abilities are shaped by the environment in which people are raised, and thus explore how learning different languages affect how people think, and how culture influences people’s basic cognition (e.g., their moral reasoning, beliefs about themselves and others, and ability to learn from and share with others). Our research takes the form of short, interactive studies that are designed to be engaging.

        <br><br>You will participate in one or a combination of the following tasks: Language comprehension and production tasks (e.g., figuring out what language means and how it should be used); General cognitive tasks (e.g., remembering things, controlling impulses); Categorization/association tasks (e.g., sorting objects or stating what comes to mind given a prompt); Search tasks (e.g., searching for or hiding objects, using maps/pictures); Temporal reasoning tasks (e.g., estimating duration, placing events on a timeline); Quantity tasks (e.g., estimating number of items, counting, deciding which set has more); Morality/sharing tasks (e.g., making moral judgments, sharing resources with others); Beliefs/attitudes tasks (e.g., expressing beliefs/attitudes about the world, yourself, and others); Social group tasks (e.g., reasoning about individuals from different social groups); Imitation tasks (e.g., imitating a presented action). These studies may present you with a variety of objects, images, or videos, and ask you to answer questions or make judgments. In some studies, you will be asked to view images or watch videos on a computer screen, and, with an eye tracker or video camera, we will record where on the screen you are looking. For some studies, with your permission, your behavior and responses may be video/audio taped throughout the testing session.

        <h2>Study Location</h2>

        The study will take place online, either via Zoom, phone, MTurk, Qualtrics, or other such virtual method. If you are asked to participate in an online survey, then you may complete it anywhere. Surveys may also be administered over the phone or by email in which case you would complete them in a location of your choice.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Benefits</h2>

        You will not receive any direct benefits. However, you will be making a substantial contribution to improving our understanding of language and thought, and by placing children’s linguistic and cognitive development in context.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Risks/Discomforts</h2>

        We do not expect you to face any foreseeable risks from your participation. However, there is the unlikely possibility that your confidentiality will be compromised but we have taken measures to minimize this risk. Usually, people enjoy participating in these studies, but if you would like to stop at any point, you can. As we may be video/audio taping your participation, there is also the chance someone might see the tape and recognize you.
    </p>

    <p>
        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>

        Your identity will be separated from your data and a numerical code will be assigned to keep track of the data transcriptions. Your confidentiality will be kept to the degree permitted by the technology being used. No guarantees can be made regarding the interception of data sent via the Internet by any third parties. Data will be kept indefinitely in case further analysis is required. All physical forms of data collected during the research will be securely stored at the University in locked rooms and electronic data will be securely stored in password-protected computers in locked rooms or stored on encrypted servers. Only laboratory or other authorized personnel will have access to these data. No individuals will be identified in any presentation or publication. Identifiers might be removed from the identifiable private information. After such removal, the information could be used for future research studies or distributed to other investigators for future research studies without additional informed consent from the subject or the legally authorized representative.

        <br><br>Video and audio data will only be shown in academic settings; the graduate student researchers and undergraduate assistants will go over these tapes in order to further examine your actions and analyze your behavior. The data will only be transcribed for relevant responses. Data and associated transcriptions may be kept indefinitely in case further analysis is required. We may want to use some of the video/audio recordings of you for academic or public presentations related to research. If you agree to allow video or audio to be used for research purposes, please read and approve the Video/Audio Permission Section at the end of this form. If you agree to additional uses of the video and audio recordings, please read, and approve the attached Media Records Release Form in addition to this permission form. We will not use any recordings or other identifiable information without permission. You may request a copy of your video and audio data.

        <br><br>Under no circumstance will any personal information about you be revealed to any person not involved with the analysis. Additionally, any video/audio recordings will be analyzed and results reported only in terms of groups of people; individuals will never be identified by name. You may request a copy of study results. You may also request a copy of any of the academic papers written by any member of our team describing a study in which your child participated as a subject.
